## Steps Taken to Transform Raw Data into Tidy Data
1. Read features.
2. Create a feature vector to name columns of both training and test datasets.
3. Read training dataset.
4. Read training dataset headers.
5. Read codes for subjects.
6. Create training data set by combining above.
7. Add a variable named source indicating training data set.
8. Read testing dataset.
9. Read testing dataset headers.
10. Read codes for subjects.
11. Create testing data set by combining above.
12. Add a variable named source indicating testing data set.
13. Combine both datasets into one.
14. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
15. Read activity names.
16. Create an activity vector to name name activities.
17. Use the above descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
18. Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
19. Create a second  independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
20. Write the tidy final dataset into a txt file.
